REVOLUTIONIZING AVIATION SAFETY THROUGH INTEGRATED AI, IoT, AND REAL-TIME DATA ANALYTICS USING SPARK-STREAMING


Despite the progressive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT),
in the aviation industry, the effective management of real-time data and the rapid detection of
Potential risks remain significant challenges. Current AI and IoT solutions offer valuable
insights, yet they often lack the ability to process large volumes of data instantaneously, limiting
their capacity to provide proactive safety measures. This predicament calls for an advanced
approach that not only leverages AI and IoT but also integrates robust data analytics techniques
for dynamic risk assessment and swift decision-making.


The introduction of Spark streaming data analysis addresses the critical limitation of existing
AI and IoT solutions by enabling real-time data processing and analysis. By incorporating Spark,
the research aims to harness the power of distributed computing, facilitating the seamless
evaluation of complex aviation data in real-time. This integration provides the aviation sector
with an edge in proactive risk management, allowing for the immediate identification of potential
safety threats and the swift implementation of preventive measures. Spark streaming data
analysis serves as a pivotal tool in the aviation safety ecosystem, empowering authorities to
navigate through massive datasets swiftly and effectively, thereby fortifying the industry's safety
infrastructure against unforeseen challenges and evolving risks
